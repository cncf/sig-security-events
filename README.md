# SIG Security Day

## ***The CNCF SIG Security has organized a security day for you - the community!***

SIG Security Day is designed to bring together the Cloud Native security community in a community oriented space to discus and share current challenges and solutions in Cloud Native Security.  This event provides a single place for people involved or getting involved in Cloud Native security to get together in a vendor neutral space.

This event allows and encourages open collaboraion and sharing of cloud native security accomplishments and roadblocks.  Cloud Native security is a multi-obejective and multi-constrained problem space spanning many areas.  Pretty much everything falls into security, from identity management to storage solutions.  We want to get people connected that are passionate about this.

#### Location
This is a Co-Located event with KubeCon + CloudNativeCon and will be held at the San Diego Convention Center, more info will be posted soon so check back for updates.

To be announced September 24th so stay tuned!

# Expectations and Takeaways

SIG Security Day will follow a format similar to DevOps Days.  In addition to keynotes and talks, we will also leverage Open Spaces in the afternoon.  We believe this format will allow for great collaborations and engagement from the Cloud Native security community to take on challenges and present solutions with one another in a more comfortable settin.  This will allow attendees to network, explore, learn, and educate all in a single day.

If you are interested in learning more about Open Spaces please check out the below:

* [DevOps Days - Open Space Format](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/)

We are hopeful that, in addition to some great exchanges that we'll be able to capture and share some of topics, discussions, and key points on through SIG Security.
